    "# Logistic Regression Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it's your turn to implement logistic regression on a new data set. For this purpose we use the Titanic Dataset. It includes personal information of all passengers on the Titanic as well as they survived the sinking of the Titanic or died.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s the **Data Dictionary** of the dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "- PassengerID: type should be integers\n",
    "\n",
    "- Survived: survived or not\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pclass: class of Travel of every passenger\n",
    "\n",
    "- Name: the name of the passenger\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sex: gender\n",
    "\n",
    "- Age: age of passengers\n",
    "\n",
    "- SibSp: No. of siblings/spouse aboard\n",
    "\n",
    "- Parch: No. of parent/child aboard\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ticket: Ticket number\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fare: what Prices they paid\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cabin: cabin number\n",
    "\n",
    "- Embarked: the port in which a passenger has embarked.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - C: Cherbourg , S: Southampton , Q: Queenstown\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You will find the data in the data folder (it's a zip folder, so you first have to unzip it).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What you should do:\n",
    "\n",
    "- conduct a brief EDA to become familiar with the data\n",
    "- use Logistic Regression to predict if a passenger died or not\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to do it:\n",
    "\n",
    "Time is short, so aim for the simplest viable product first:\n",
    "1. Load the data\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Separate features and target \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Split the data in train and test\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Get a quick overview of the train data\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Agree on a classification metric for the task \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Create a simple heuristic/educated guess for the classification first. This is called a \"baseline model\". It is used to compare more complex models later (in this case: logistic regression). You as a data scientist want to prove how much your work/ML could improve the business metric, therefore you need a baseline model for comparison. In some cases you want to improve on an already existing model in your company which would be your baseline model then. In other cases, there are typical baseline models used in the specific field. For other tasks, you have to come up with a simple but meaningful idea, how to classify the data based on your business understanding (EDA). A baseline model should follow Occam’s Razor principle: \"A simple model is the best model\". \n",
    "    - Example of a baseline model: \n",
    "    If the task is to classify cats and dogs, a baseline model could be: We classify every animal as cat if its weight < 5 kg, otherwise the animal is classified as a dog. (The value of 5 kg is an educated guess, based on our business understanding/EDA.) \n",
    "\n",
    "6. use one or two already numerical features to create a simple first model\n",
    "    -  did it even beat your base model?\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Now you can go through the data science lifecycle again and again:\n",
    "    - clean the data better\n",
    "\n",
    "    - get more insights with EDA\n",
    "\n",
    "    - add more features\n",
    "\n",
    "    - do feature engineering \n",
    "    \n",
    "    and check if your work improves your model further!\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Stop whenever time is up or you cannot improve your model any further.\n",
    "\n",
    "This repo a solution to this problem. If you want to compare your final result with the result of this repo solution, choose **25** as random seed and a test size of 30% for your train test split."
